"""# Functions and Interfaces

This chapter introduces a module called `jupyturtle`, which allows you to create simple drawings by giving instructions to an imaginary turtle.
We will use this module to write functions that draw squares, polygons, and circles -- and to demonstrate **interface design**, which is a way of designing functions that work together.

## The jupyturtle module

To use the `jupyturtle` module, we can import it like this.
"""

import jupyturtle

"""Now we can use the functions defined in the module, like `make_turtle` and `forward`."""

jupyturtle.make_turtle()
jupyturtle.forward(10)

"""`make_turtle` creates a **canvas**, which is a space on the screen where we can draw, and a turtle, which is represented by a circular shell and a triangular head.
The circle shows the location of the turtle and the triangle indicates the direction it is facing.

`forward` moves the turtle a given distance in the direction it's facing, drawing a line segment along the way.
The distance is in arbitrary units -- the actual size depends on your computer's screen.

We will use functions defined in the `jupyturtle` module many times, so it would be nice if we did not have to write the name of the module every time.
That's possible if we import the module like this.
"""

from jupyturtle import make_turtle, forward

"""This version of the import statement imports `make_turtle` and `forward` from the `jupyturtle` module so we can call them like this."""

We'll import them like this.
"""

from jupyturtle import left, right

For example, we can make a 90 degree left turn like this.

One of the benefits of encapsulation is that it attaches a name to the code, which serves as a kind of documentation. Another advantage is that if you re-use the code, it is more concise to call a function twice than to copy and paste the body!

In the current version, the size of the square is always `50`.
If we want to draw squares with different sizes, we can take the length of the sides as a parameter.

"""Adding a parameter to a function is called **generalization** because it makes the function more general: with the previous version, the square is always the same size; with this version it can be any size.

"""

poligono(n=7,largo=50)

"""These are sometimes called "named arguments" because they include the parameter names.
But in Python they are more often called **keyword arguments** (not to be confused with Python keywords like `for` and `def`).

This use of the assignment operator, `=`, is a reminder about how arguments and parameters work -- when you call a function, the arguments are assigned to the parameters.

## Approximating a circle

Now suppose we want to draw a circle.
We can do that, approximately, by drawing a polygon with a large number of sides, so each side is small enough that it's hard to see.
Here is a function that uses `polygon` to draw a `30`-sided polygon that approximates a circle.
"""

import math

def circulo(radio,n): #Con dos parametros para que sea m
  circunferencia= radio * 2 * math.pi
  largo = circunferencia/n
  poligono(n,largo)

"""`circle` takes the radius of the the circle as a parameter.
It computes `circumference`, which is the circumference of a circle with the given radius.
`n` is the number of sides, so `circumference / n` is the length of each side.

This function might take a long time to run.
We can speed it up by calling `make_turtle` with a keyword argument called `delay` that sets the time, in seconds, the turtle waits after each step.
The default value is `0.2` seconds -- if we set it to `0.02` it runs about 10 times faster.
"""

make_turtle(delay=0.02)
circulo(50,300)

"""A limitation of this solution is that `n` is a constant, which means
that for very big circles, the sides are too long, and for small
circles, we waste time drawing very short sides.
One option is to generalize the function by taking `n` as a parameter.
But let's keep it simple for now.

## Refactoring

Now let's write a more general version of `circle`, called `arc`, that takes a second parameter, `angle`, and draws an arc of a circle that spans the given angle.
For example, if `angle` is `360` degrees, it draws a complete circle. If `angle` is `180` degrees, it draws a half circle.

To write `circle`, we were able to reuse `polygon`, because a many-sided polygon is a good approximation of a circle.
But we can't use `polygon` to write `arc`.

Instead, we'll create the more general version of `polygon`, called `polyline`.
"""

def polyline(n,lenght,angle):
  for i in range(n):
    forward(lenght)
    left(angle)

"""`polyline` takes as parameters the number of line segments to draw, `n`, the length of the segments, `length`, and the angle between them, `angle`.

Now we can rewrite `polygon` to use `polyline`.
"""

def polygon(lenght, n):
  angle = 360/n
  polyline(n,lenght,angle)

"""And we can use `polyline` to write `arc`."""

def arc(radius, angle): #el angulo que quiero
    arc_length = 2 * math.pi * radius * angle / 360 # así solamente apunto al pedazo de arco que quiero multiplicando toda la circunferencia por el pedazo que si quiero
    n = 30 #cantidad de lados"
    length = arc_length / n
    step_angle = angle / n
    polyline(n, length, step_angle)

"""`arc` is similar to `circle`, except that it computes `arc_length`, which is a fraction of the circumference of a circle.

Finally, we can rewrite `circle` to use `arc`.
"""

def circulo(radio): #esta función te entrega el circulo entero
 arc(radio,360)

"""To check that these functions work as expected, we'll use them to draw something like a snail.
With `delay=0`, the turtle runs as fast as possible.
"""



"""In this example, we started with working code and reorganized it with different functions.
Changes like this, which improve the code without changing its behavior, are called **refactoring**.

If we had planned ahead, we might have written `polyline` first and avoided refactoring, but often you don't know enough at the beginning of a project to design all the functions.
Once you start coding, you understand the problem better.
Sometimes refactoring is a sign that you have learned something.

## Stack diagram

When we call `circle`, it calls `arc`, which calls `polyline`.
We can use a stack diagram to show this sequence of function calls and the parameters for each one.
"""

from diagram import make_binding, make_frame, Frame, Stack

frame1 = make_frame(dict(radius=30), name='circle', loc='left')

frame2 = make_frame(dict(radius=30, angle=360), name='arc', loc='left', dx=1.1)

frame3 = make_frame(dict(n=60, length=3.04, angle=5.8),
                    name='polyline', loc='left', dx=1.1, offsetx=-0.27)

stack = Stack([frame1, frame2, frame3], dy=-0.4)

from diagram import diagram, adjust

width, height, x, y = [3.58, 1.31, 0.98, 1.06]
ax = diagram(width, height)
bbox = stack.draw(ax, x, y)
#adjust(x, y, bbox)

"""Notice that the value of `angle` in `polyline` is different from the value of `angle` in `arc`.
Parameters are local, which means you can use the same parameter name in different functions; it's a different variable in each function, and it can refer to a different value.

## A development plan

A **development plan** is a process for writing programs.
The process we used in this chapter is "encapsulation and generalization".
The steps of this process are:

1.  Start by writing a small program with no function definitions.

2.  Once you get the program working, identify a coherent piece of it,
    encapsulate the piece in a function and give it a name.

3.  Generalize the function by adding appropriate parameters.

4.  Repeat Steps 1 to 3 until you have a set of working functions.

5.  Look for opportunities to improve the program by refactoring. For
    example, if you have similar code in several places, consider
    factoring it into an appropriately general function.

This process has some drawbacks -- we will see alternatives later -- but it can be useful if you don't know ahead of time how to divide the program into functions.
This approach lets you design as you go along.

The design of a function has two parts:

* The **interface** is how the function is used, including its name, the parameters it takes and what the function is supposed to do.

* The **implementation** is how the function does what it's supposed to do.

For example, here's the first version of `circle` we wrote, which uses `polygon`.
"""

def circle(radius):
    circumference = 2 * math.pi * radius
    n = 30
    length = circumference / n
    polygon(n, length)

"""And here's the refactored version that uses `arc`."""

def circle(radius):
    arc(radius,  360)

"""These two functions have the same interface -- they take the same parameters and do the same thing -- but they have different implementations.

## Docstrings

A **docstring** is a string at the beginning of a function that explains the interface ("doc" is short for "documentation").
Here is an example:
"""

def demo():

 """ este es un codigo demo
para mostrar como funciona el docstrings"""

 print("que tal")

demo()

"""By convention, docstrings are triple-quoted strings, also known as **multiline strings** because the triple quotes allow the string to span more than one line.

A docstring should:

* Explain concisely what the function does, without getting into the details of how it works,

* Explain what effect each parameter has on the behavior of the function, and

* Indicate what type each parameter should be, if it is not obvious.

Writing this kind of documentation is an important part of interface design.
A well-designed interface should be simple to explain; if you have a hard time explaining one of your functions, maybe the interface could be improved.

## Debugging

An interface is like a contract between a function and a caller. The
caller agrees to provide certain arguments and the function agrees to
do certain work.

For example, `polyline` requires three arguments: `n` has to be an integer; `length` should be a positive number; and `angle` has to be a number, which is understood to be in degrees.

These requirements are called **preconditions** because they are supposed to be true before the function starts executing. Conversely, conditions at the end of the function are **postconditions**.
Postconditions include the intended effect of the function (like drawing line segments) and any side effects (like moving the turtle or making other changes).

Preconditions are the responsibility of the caller. If the caller violates a precondition and the function doesn't work correctly, the bug is in the caller, not the function.

If the preconditions are satisfied and the postconditions are not, the bug is in the function. If your pre- and postconditions are clear, they can help with debugging.
